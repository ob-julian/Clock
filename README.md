## As Wallpaper

You can of course also use is as a wallpaer on your desktop, e.g. with Lively Wallpaper

### Lively Wallpaper

1. Download and install [Lively Wallpaper](https://rocksdanister.github.io/lively/)
2. Open Lively Wallpaper
3. Go to `Bibliothek` and click on the `+` on the right hand side
4. Choose `File` and select the `src/english.html` or the language you prefer
5. Click on `Apply Changes` and you are done

This project has implemented the Live Wallpaper API, so you can customize a few things for your wallpaper, like the color theme.

If you dont want any customization, you can also just add [https://oberhofer.ddns.net/clock/english](https://oberhofer.ddns.net/clock/english) or the language you prefer as a wallpaper.
The Thumbnail will be horrendous, but the wallpaper will work just fine.

### Other Wallpaper Engines

From my side, I do not intend to implement other wallpaper engines, but this is an open source project, so feel free to implement it yourself and create a pull request if you want to share it with others.
